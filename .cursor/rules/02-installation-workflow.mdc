# Installation Workflow

The installer follows a specific workflow to set up the formatting tools:

1. **Detection** - Checks which package manager is used (npm, pnpm, or bun) by looking for lock files
2. **Installation** - Installs husky, lint-staged, and prettier as dev dependencies
3. **Husky Setup** - Initializes husky
4. **Configuration** - Sets up lint-staged in package.json
5. **File Setup** - Copies .prettierrc and .prettierignore files
6. **Hook Setup** - Configures the pre-commit hook to run lint-staged

This process is handled in [bin/cli.js](mdc:bin/cli.js) with detailed steps for each package manager.
