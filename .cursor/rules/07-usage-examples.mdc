# Usage Examples

The `prettier-husky-lint-staged-installer` can be run using different package managers.

## Running with npx (npm)

```bash
npx prettier-husky-lint-staged-installer
```

## Running with pnpm

```bash
pnpm dlx prettier-husky-lint-staged-installer
```

## Running with bun

```bash
bunx prettier-husky-lint-staged-installer
```

## What Gets Installed

After running the installer, your project will have:

1. Husky, lint-staged, and Prettier installed as dev dependencies
2. A pre-commit hook that runs Prettier on staged files
3. A `.prettierrc` config file with sensible defaults
4. A `.prettierignore` file
5. Package.json scripts for running Prettier manually

## Resulting Configuration

The installer adds this to your package.json:

```json
"lint-staged": {
  "*": "prettier --ignore-unknown --write"
},
"scripts": {
  "prettier": "prettier --ignore-unknown --write ."
}
```

And creates a pre-commit hook to run lint-staged.
